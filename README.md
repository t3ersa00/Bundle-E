<ins>Use Github Pages and use markdown language syntax (not HTML) to create a static website. Maybe you can host some WASM application there such as x86 emulation, Qt for WASM, or just Awesome WebAssembly Applications. 
However, just a static website is also fine:</ins>

- _Website must be public_
- _Use at least handful of Github flavour markdown features to format the web page_
- _Document your work progress with few screenshots to the learning diary_
- _Write the Github page address to the learning diary so that your peer reviewers can verify it easily_
- _Keep the pages available until you have received your course grade_
